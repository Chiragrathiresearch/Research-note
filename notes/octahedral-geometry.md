## Status
Exploratory notes. Concepts are under active development and subject to revision.

## Motivation
Octahedral symmetry appears as a minimal non-trivial 3D polyhedral structure
with strong implications for:
- Spatial tiling
- Load distribution
- Orbital and relay geometry
- Symmetry-constrained energy flow

This note explores abstract and physical interpretations of octahedral geometry
as a foundational unit for higher-order systems.

## Core Concepts
- Octahedral symmetry group (Oh)
- Vertex–edge–face duality
- Relation to cubic and spherical embeddings
- Constraint-driven geometry

## Thought Experiments
- Octahedral shells as relay-node frameworks
- Stability under rotational perturbations
- Mapping orbital planes to face normals

## Open Questions
- What limits octahedral scalability?
- Can octahedral lattices outperform cubic grids under constraint?
- How does symmetry breaking affect system efficiency?

## Next Steps
- Formal mathematical representation
- Simple simulation models
- Cross-comparison with tetrahedral and cubic systems
