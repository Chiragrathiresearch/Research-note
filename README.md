Overview

This repository serves as a central research hub consolidating my independent academic work, hypotheses, experimental notes, and ongoing theoretical explorations. The goal is not volume, but clarity, traceability, and rigor.

All major works are indexed through ORCID. This repository provides:

Transparent versioning of ideas

Structured documentation

Supplementary material not suitable for journals



---

Research Philosophy

I follow a first-principles, system-level approach:

Understand mechanisms, not memorization

Prefer falsifiable hypotheses (null-first framing)

Use mathematics and models to reduce ambiguity


> If a claim cannot be tested, it is treated as incomplete.
