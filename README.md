## Overview

This repository records ongoing and archived independent research, including formal outputs and exploratory material.

It consolidates archived publications, hypotheses, analytical notes, and exploratory models.

The objective is clarity, traceability, and methodological rigor — not volume.

All finalized work is archived externally (Zenodo) and indexed via ORCID.  
This repository focuses on structure, versioning, and transparent development.

## Research Approach

This work follows a first-principles, system-level methodology:

- These principles are applied across all projects listed below,
with explicit assumptions, constraints, and failure modes documented.

> If a claim cannot be tested or constrained, it is treated as incomplete.

## Hypotheses & Models

These models are exploratory and constrained by explicitly stated assumptions.  
They are intended as starting points for formal testing, simulation, or critique.  
This section prioritizes conceptual clarity over empirical completeness.

Ongoing work in this repository adheres to the following standards:

- Clearly defined scope and assumptions  
- Explicit null hypotheses where applicable  
- Mathematical or logical structure when possible  
- Identification of testability limits and failure modes  

Exploratory ideas are marked as such and are **not presented as conclusions**.

## Experimental & Analytical Notes
Notes range from qualitative reasoning sketches to quantitative
back-of-the-envelope models and preliminary simulation designs.

This section includes:

- Thought experiments  
- Simulation outlines  
- Error analysis and uncertainty tracking  
- Limitations and unresolved questions  

These notes are maintained for transparency and iterative refinement.

---

## Methodology Standards

- Definitions precede conclusions  
- Observation is separated from interpretation  
- Uncertainty is explicitly documented  
- Negative results and constraints are preserved  

---

## Potential extensions subject to validation and feedback

- Identified theoretical and mathematical gaps  
- Model refinement and validation pathways  
- Extension toward computational implementation  
- Cross-domain synthesis where appropriate
